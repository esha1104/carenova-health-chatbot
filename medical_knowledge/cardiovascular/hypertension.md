# Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)

## Category
Chronic Cardiovascular Disorder

---

## Description
Hypertension is a long-term condition in which the force of blood against artery walls remains consistently elevated.

Over time, uncontrolled high blood pressure damages blood vessels and significantly increases the risk of:

- heart attack  
- stroke  
- kidney failure  
- vision loss  
- heart failure  

It is often called the **“silent killer”** because many people have no symptoms.

---

## Diagnostic Hint
Suspect hypertension when **repeated blood pressure readings exceed normal ranges**, even in the absence of symptoms.

---

## Core Symptom Pattern
Usually asymptomatic and detected during routine blood pressure checks.

---

## Dominant Feature
Persistently elevated blood pressure.

---

## Blood Pressure Classification

| Level | Reading |
|--------|------------|
| Normal | <120 / <80 mm Hg |
| Elevated | 120–129 / <80 |
| Stage 1 Hypertension | 130–139 OR 80–89 |
| Stage 2 Hypertension | ≥140 OR ≥90 |

Diagnosis requires **multiple readings**, not a single measurement.

---

## Common Symptoms
Most people experience **no symptoms**.

Occasionally:

- mild headaches  
- dizziness  
- facial flushing  

But these are unreliable indicators.

---

## Key Differentiating Features
Strong indicators include:

- consistently high BP readings  
- absence of infection symptoms  
- gradual progression  
- discovered during routine screening  

Normal feeling **does NOT mean normal blood pressure.**

---

## Rare Symptoms
Often indicate advanced or uncontrolled hypertension:

- severe headaches  
- blurred vision  
- chest discomfort  
- fatigue  
- irregular heartbeat  

---

##  Emergency Signs — Hypertensive Crisis

Seek immediate medical care if ANY occur with very high BP:

- severe headache  
- chest pain  
- severe shortness of breath  
- confusion  
- vision loss  
- numbness or weakness  
- difficulty speaking  
- seizures  

These may signal stroke, heart attack, or organ damage.

---

## Hypertensive Crisis Threshold

**≥180 systolic OR ≥120 diastolic**

This is a medical emergency.

---

## Cause

### Primary (Essential) Hypertension
- No single identifiable cause  
- Develops gradually over years  

### Secondary Hypertension
Caused by underlying conditions such as:

- kidney disease  
- hormonal disorders  
- thyroid problems  
- sleep apnea  
- certain medications  

Often appears suddenly.

---

## Disease Pattern
Chronic and lifelong but manageable.

---

## Progression Speed
Typically slow — but damage accumulates silently.

---

## Risk Factors
- obesity  
- high sodium intake  
- sedentary lifestyle  
- smoking  
- excessive alcohol  
- chronic stress  
- family history  
- diabetes  
- age over 40  

---

## Commonly Confused With
- temporary stress-related BP spikes  
- anxiety  
- panic attacks  

Temporary elevation is NOT the same as chronic hypertension.

---

## Severity Level
Serious even without symptoms.

Uncontrolled hypertension is a leading global cause of death.

---

## When to See a Doctor
- repeated high BP readings  
- headaches with elevated BP  
- chest discomfort  
- vision changes  
- dizziness  

Early treatment prevents complications.

---

## Diagnosis
Confirmed using multiple blood pressure measurements over time.

Home BP monitoring is often recommended.

---

## Treatment Overview
Focuses on lowering cardiovascular risk through:

- lifestyle modifications  
- regular monitoring  
- antihypertensive medications  

---

## Prevention
- maintain healthy body weight  
- exercise regularly  
- reduce salt intake  
- eat a heart-healthy diet  
- avoid smoking  
- limit alcohol  
- manage stress  

Even small BP reductions significantly lower stroke risk.

---

## Fever Pattern
Absent.

---

## Onset Pattern
Very gradual — often unnoticed for years.

---

## Clinical Insight

### Hypertension vs Anxiety Spike

**Hypertension:** persistently elevated readings  
**Anxiety:** temporary spike that normalizes  

Always confirm with repeated measurements.
