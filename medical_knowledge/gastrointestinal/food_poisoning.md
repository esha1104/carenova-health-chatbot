# Food Poisoning

## Category
Acute Digestive Illness (Foodborne Infection)

---

## Description
Food poisoning is a sudden digestive illness caused by consuming contaminated food or water containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites, or toxins. Symptoms usually appear quickly and resolve within a short period.

---

## Diagnostic Hint
Suspect food poisoning when **nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea begin within hours after eating**, especially if others who ate the same food also become ill.

---

## Core Symptom Pattern
Rapid-onset gastrointestinal illness following recent food exposure.

---

## Common Symptoms
- nausea  
- vomiting  
- diarrhea  
- stomach pain or cramps  
- fever  
- headache  
- weakness  

---

## Key Differentiating Symptoms
Strong indicators of food poisoning:

- symptoms begin quickly (often **2–6 hours** after eating)  
- clear link to suspicious or improperly stored food  
- multiple people affected after the same meal  
- abrupt symptom onset  
- short illness duration (typically **12–48 hours**)  

---

## Rare Symptoms
These may indicate a severe infection or toxin exposure:

- bloody diarrhea  
- severe dehydration  
- blurred vision  
- muscle weakness  
- neurological symptoms  
- kidney complications  

---

##  Emergency Signs
Seek urgent care if:

- unable to stay hydrated  
- persistent high fever  
- blood in vomit or stool  
- confusion  
- very low urination  
- dizziness or fainting  
- difficulty breathing  

---

## Cause
Occurs after consuming food contaminated with infectious organisms or toxins.

---

## Common Pathogens

**Bacteria**
- Salmonella  
- E. coli  
- Listeria  
- Campylobacter  
- Shigella  

**Viruses**
- Norovirus (very common)

**Toxins**
- Staphylococcal toxins  
- Botulinum toxin (rare but life-threatening)

---

## Disease Pattern
Acute and self-limiting in most cases.

---

## Progression Speed
Very rapid onset compared to most infections.

Symptoms often appear within hours rather than days.

---

## Symptom Duration
Usually resolves within **1–2 days**, though some bacterial infections may last longer.

---

## Primary Risk
**Severe dehydration** due to vomiting and diarrhea.

---

## Transmission Mode
Primarily through contaminated food or water.

Some infections may spread through poor hygiene.

---

## Risk Factors
- improperly stored food  
- undercooked meat or seafood  
- unpasteurized dairy  
- contaminated water  
- weakened immune system  
- pregnancy  
- young children  
- older adults  

---

## Commonly Confused With
- gastroenteritis  
- typhoid fever  
- cholera  
- appendicitis (early symptoms)  

---

## Severity Level
Typically mild — but can become dangerous if dehydration or toxin exposure occurs.

Certain pathogens can cause life-threatening complications.

---

## When to See a Doctor
- symptoms lasting longer than **48 hours**  
- persistent vomiting  
- high fever  
- signs of dehydration  
- blood in stool  

---

## Diagnosis
Usually based on symptom history and recent food exposure.

Lab testing may be used during outbreaks or severe illness.

---

## Treatment Overview
Treatment focuses on:

- hydration  
- electrolyte replacement  
- rest  

Severe infections may require antibiotics or hospitalization.

---

## Prevention
- proper food handling  
- thorough cooking  
- refrigerating perishables  
- avoiding cross-contamination  
- frequent handwashing  

---

## Exposure Pattern
Symptoms begin shortly after eating contaminated food.

---

## Dominant Symptoms
Vomiting and diarrhea with rapid onset.

---

## Quick Differentiation

**Food Poisoning:** symptoms within hours after a meal  
**Gastroenteritis:** infection-based, not always tied to one meal  
**Typhoid:** slow rising fever  
**Appendicitis:** localized abdominal pain  

---

## Clinical Insight
The timing of symptoms is the biggest diagnostic clue.  
Illness beginning within hours of eating strongly suggests foodborne toxin exposure rather than a systemic infection.
