# Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

## Category
Chronic Digestive Disorder

---

## Description
GERD is a long-term condition in which stomach acid repeatedly flows back into the esophagus, irritating its lining and causing a burning sensation in the chest known as heartburn.

---

## Diagnostic Hint
Suspect GERD when **burning chest discomfort occurs after meals**, worsens when lying down, and improves when sitting upright or taking antacids.

---

## Core Symptom Pattern
Post-meal acid reflux causing burning chest discomfort.

---

## Dominant Symptom
Heartburn — a burning sensation behind the breastbone.

---

## Common Symptoms
- burning chest pain (heartburn)  
- acid taste in mouth  
- regurgitation of food or sour liquid  
- difficulty swallowing  
- chronic cough  
- hoarseness  
- throat irritation  
- sensation of a lump in the throat  

---

## Key Differentiating Features
Strong indicators of GERD:

- symptoms worsen after eating  
- worse when lying down or bending over  
- triggered by large or fatty meals  
- improves with antacids  
- typically **no fever**  
- not caused by infection  

---

## Rare Symptoms
May suggest complications:

- persistent chest pain  
- severe swallowing difficulty  
- recurrent vomiting  
- unexplained weight loss  

---

##  Emergency Signs
Seek immediate care if symptoms resemble a heart emergency:

- chest pain with shortness of breath  
- pain spreading to jaw, shoulder, or arm  
- sudden crushing chest pressure  
- dizziness or fainting  

Always rule out cardiac causes first when chest pain is severe.

---

## Cause
Weakening or improper relaxation of the **lower esophageal sphincter (LES)** allows stomach acid to flow backward into the esophagus.

---

## Disease Pattern
Chronic condition with recurring flare-ups.

---

## Onset Pattern
Often begins **after meals** or when lying down shortly after eating.

---

## Fever Pattern
Absent — fever suggests an alternate diagnosis.

---

## Progression Speed
Gradual and recurrent rather than sudden.

---

## Pain Type
Burning, meal-related chest discomfort.

(Not sharp or stabbing.)

---

## Temporal Trigger
Occurs after eating, during nighttime, or when bending over.

---

## Risk Factors
- obesity  
- pregnancy  
- smoking  
- hiatal hernia  
- large meals  
- late-night eating  
- fatty or spicy foods  
- caffeine or alcohol  

---

## Commonly Confused With
- heart attack  
- gastritis  
- peptic ulcer disease  
- anxiety-related chest discomfort  
- esophageal spasm  

---

## Severity Level
Usually manageable but may cause complications if untreated.

Possible complications include:

- esophagitis  
- narrowing of the esophagus  
- Barrett’s esophagus  

---

## When to See a Doctor
- symptoms occurring multiple times per week  
- difficulty swallowing  
- persistent chest pain  
- chronic cough  
- symptoms not improving with medication  

---

## Diagnosis
Primarily clinical.

Tests may include:

- upper endoscopy  
- esophageal pH monitoring  
- manometry  

---

## Treatment Overview
Managed through lifestyle changes and medications that reduce stomach acid.

Severe cases may require surgical intervention.

---

## Prevention
- avoid lying down for at least 2–3 hours after meals  
- eat smaller portions  
- maintain a healthy weight  
- stop smoking  
- limit trigger foods  

---

## Quick Differentiation

**GERD:** burning pain after meals  
**Heart attack:** crushing pressure with breathlessness  
**Gastritis:** stomach-centered pain  
**Ulcer:** localized upper abdominal pain  

---

## Clinical Insight
The combination of **post-meal burning pain + positional worsening + absence of fever** strongly suggests acid reflux rather than infection or cardiac disease.
