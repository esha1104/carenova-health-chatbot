# Gastroenteritis

## Category
Acute Gastrointestinal Infection

---

## Description
Gastroenteritis is inflammation of the stomach and intestines that causes sudden vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and digestive distress. It is most commonly triggered by viral or bacterial infections and typically resolves within a few days.

---

## Diagnostic Hint
Suspect gastroenteritis when **vomiting and diarrhea begin suddenly and occur together**, especially without signs of a severe systemic infection.

---

## Core Symptom Pattern
Acute onset of vomiting PLUS diarrhea with abdominal cramps.

---

## Common Symptoms
- diarrhea  
- nausea  
- vomiting  
- abdominal pain or cramping  
- loss of appetite  
- fatigue  
- mild fever  
- body aches  
- chills  

---

## Key Differentiating Symptoms
Signs strongly suggesting gastroenteritis:

- simultaneous vomiting and diarrhea  
- sudden symptom onset  
- rapid fluid loss  
- short illness duration (typically 1–3 days)  
- generalized abdominal discomfort rather than localized severe pain  

---

## Rare Symptoms
- high fever  
- blood in stool  
- prolonged vomiting  
- severe dehydration  

These may indicate a more serious infection.

---

##  Emergency Signs
Seek urgent care if:

- unable to keep fluids down  
- signs of severe dehydration (dry mouth, dizziness, minimal urination)  
- confusion or lethargy  
- blood in stool or vomit  
- severe or localized abdominal pain  

---

## Cause
Most commonly caused by infections such as:

**Viruses**
- norovirus (most common)  
- rotavirus  

**Bacteria**
- E. coli  
- Salmonella  
- Campylobacter  

Less commonly caused by parasites or chemical toxins.

---

## Transmission Mode
Spreads through the **fecal-oral route**, typically via:

- contaminated food or water  
- poor hand hygiene  
- close contact with infected individuals  

---

## Disease Pattern
Acute and self-limiting in most cases.

Recovery usually occurs within a few days if hydration is maintained.

---

## Progression Speed
Rapid onset — often within hours to a day after exposure.

---

## Symptom Duration
Typically **1–3 days**, though bacterial infections may last longer.

---

## Primary Risk
**Dehydration** due to fluid and electrolyte loss.

This is the main reason complications occur.

---

## Risk Factors
- contaminated food or water  
- poor sanitation  
- travel to high-risk regions  
- weakened immune system  
- young children  
- older adults  
- crowded environments  

---

## Commonly Confused With
- food poisoning  
- typhoid fever  
- cholera  
- appendicitis (early stage)  

---

## Severity Level
Usually mild — but dehydration can become dangerous without proper fluid replacement.

---

## When to See a Doctor
- symptoms lasting more than 3–5 days  
- persistent vomiting  
- high fever  
- signs of dehydration  
- blood in stool  

---

## Diagnosis
Typically based on symptoms.

Stool or blood tests may be used in severe or prolonged cases.

---

## Treatment Overview
Treatment focuses on **supportive care**, especially:

- oral rehydration  
- electrolyte replacement  
- rest  

Antibiotics are only used for specific bacterial infections.

---

## Prevention
- proper handwashing  
- safe food handling  
- clean drinking water  
- disinfect contaminated surfaces  

---

## Fever Pattern
Usually mild and short-lived.

---

## Dominant Symptom
Vomiting with diarrhea.

---

## Exposure Pattern
Often linked to infectious spread rather than a single suspicious meal.

---

## Quick Differentiation

**Gastroenteritis:** vomiting + diarrhea, short duration  
**Food Poisoning:** symptoms strongly linked to a recent meal  
**Typhoid:** persistent rising fever + abdominal pain  
**Cholera:** severe watery diarrhea with extreme dehydration  

---

## Clinical Insight
The greatest danger in gastroenteritis is not the infection itself — but rapid dehydration. Early fluid replacement dramatically reduces complications.
