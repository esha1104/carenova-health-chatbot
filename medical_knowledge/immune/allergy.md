# Allergic Reaction (Allergy)

## Category
Immune System Disorder

---

## Description
An allergic reaction occurs when the immune system overreacts to substances that are normally harmless, such as pollen, foods, medications, insect stings, or pet dander.

Reactions can range from mild irritation to **anaphylaxis**, a rapidly life-threatening emergency.

---

## Diagnostic Hint
Suspect an allergic reaction when symptoms appear **soon after exposure to a trigger**, especially when itching, rash, or swelling occurs without signs of infection.

---

## Core Symptom Pattern
Rapid onset symptoms following allergen exposure.

---

## Dominant Feature
Itching and swelling shortly after trigger contact.

---

## Common Symptoms
- sneezing  
- runny or blocked nose  
- itchy or watery eyes  
- skin rash  
- hives (urticaria)  
- generalized itching  
- mild swelling (lips, eyelids, face)  
- throat irritation  

---

## Respiratory Symptoms
- nasal congestion  
- cough  
- chest tightness  
- wheezing  

Wheezing suggests airway involvement → higher risk reaction.

---

## Skin Symptoms
- raised itchy welts (hives)  
- redness  
- contact rash  
- localized swelling  

Skin symptoms are often the **earliest sign**.

---

## Food-Related Symptoms
- tingling in the mouth  
- swelling of lips or tongue  
- nausea  
- vomiting  
- abdominal cramps  

Rapid mouth or throat symptoms are warning signs.

---

## Key Differentiating Features
- symptoms begin soon after exposure  
- itching is prominent  
- fever is typically absent  
- symptoms improve when trigger is removed  
- not caused by infection  

Presence of itching strongly favors allergy over viral illness.

---

## Rare Symptoms
Often signal a severe reaction:

- severe facial swelling  
- difficulty swallowing  
- persistent wheezing  
- voice changes  

---

#  Emergency Signs — Possible Anaphylaxis

Seek immediate medical care if ANY occur:

- throat tightening  
- difficulty breathing  
- swelling of tongue  
- rapid drop in blood pressure  
- dizziness or fainting  
- bluish lips  
- confusion  
- loss of consciousness  

Anaphylaxis can become fatal within minutes.

---

## Critical Condition — Anaphylaxis
A severe whole-body allergic reaction that causes airway narrowing and circulatory collapse.

**Requires immediate epinephrine injection and emergency care.**

Do NOT wait for symptoms to improve.

---

## Biphasic Reaction Warning (Advanced Clinical Insight)
Some people improve after treatment but develop a second severe reaction hours later.

Medical observation is often recommended after anaphylaxis.

---

## Cause
Triggered by immune response to allergens such as:

- pollen  
- foods (nuts, shellfish, eggs, milk)  
- medications (especially antibiotics)  
- insect stings  
- latex  
- animal dander  

---

## Onset Pattern
Usually rapid — **minutes to hours** after exposure.

Faster onset → higher risk.

---

## Fever Pattern
Absent.

Fever suggests infection rather than allergy.

---

## Disease Pattern
Episodic and trigger-dependent.

---

## Risk Factors
- family history of allergies  
- asthma  
- prior allergic reactions  
- repeated allergen exposure  
- certain food allergies  

Previous anaphylaxis greatly increases future risk.

---

## Commonly Confused With
- common cold  
- viral infection  
- asthma attack  
- skin infections  

**Cold → fever + gradual onset**  
**Allergy → itching + rapid onset**

---

## Severity Level
Highly variable.

Ranges from mild irritation to life-threatening emergency.

---

## When to See a Doctor
- persistent allergy symptoms  
- recurrent reactions  
- breathing discomfort  
- suspected food or drug allergy  

Early evaluation helps prevent severe episodes.

---

## Diagnosis
Based primarily on history and symptom patterns.

Allergy testing may identify triggers.

---

## Treatment Overview
Treatment focuses on:

- antihistamines  
- corticosteroids  
- trigger avoidance  
- emergency epinephrine for severe reactions  

Patients with severe allergies are often advised to carry an auto-injector.

---

## Prevention
- identify triggers  
- avoid known allergens  
- maintain clean indoor air  
- read food and medication labels carefully  

Preparation saves lives.

---

## Trigger Pattern
Symptoms typically appear shortly after allergen exposure.

---

## Itching Present
YES — a major diagnostic clue.

Absence of itching should prompt evaluation for other causes.
