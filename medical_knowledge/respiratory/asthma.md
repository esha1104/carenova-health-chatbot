# Asthma

## Category
Chronic Respiratory Disease

---

## PRIMARY SYMPTOMS
shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, coughing

---


## Description
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung condition in which the airways become swollen and narrowed, making breathing difficult. Symptoms often occur in **episodes called asthma attacks**, which may range from mild to life-threatening.

---

## Diagnostic Hint
Suspect asthma when **recurrent shortness of breath** occurs together with:

- wheezing  
- chest tightness  
- persistent coughing  

Especially after exposure to triggers such as allergens, exercise, smoke, or cold air.

---

## Core Symptom Pattern
**Episodic breathing difficulty with wheezing**, rather than continuous illness.

---

## Common Symptoms
- shortness of breath  
- wheezing (whistling sound during exhalation)  
- chest tightness  
- persistent cough (often worse at night or early morning)  
- rapid breathing  
- sleep disturbance due to breathing problems  

---

## Key Differentiating Symptoms
These strongly suggest asthma over other lung conditions:

- wheezing during exhalation  
- symptoms triggered by allergens or physical activity  
- symptoms improve with inhaler use  
- episodic attacks instead of constant symptoms  

---

## Rare Symptoms
- bluish lips or fingernails (low oxygen)  
- severe anxiety during breathing difficulty  
- inability to speak full sentences  

---

##  Emergency Signs
Seek immediate medical care if:

- severe breathing difficulty occurs  
- lips or nails turn blue or gray  
- rescue inhaler does NOT relieve symptoms  
- chest retractions (skin pulling inward while breathing)  
- confusion or drowsiness  

---

## Cause
Asthma results from **chronic airway inflammation**, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.

---

## Common Triggers
- dust mites  
- pollen  
- smoke  
- air pollution  
- pet dander  
- mold  
- cold air  
- respiratory infections  
- strong odors  
- exercise  

---

## Disease Pattern
Chronic condition with **intermittent flare-ups**.

---

## Fever Presence
❗ Usually **absent**.  
Fever suggests an infection rather than asthma.

(This is a powerful diagnostic separator for your bot.)

---

## Reversibility
Airway narrowing is typically **reversible with treatment**, unlike COPD.

---

## Risk Factors
- family history of asthma or allergies  
- childhood respiratory infections  
- obesity  
- tobacco smoke exposure  
- occupational chemical exposure  
- pre-existing allergies  

---

## Commonly Confused With
- COPD  
- bronchitis  
- pneumonia  
- severe allergic reaction  

---

## Severity Level
Ranges from mild intermittent symptoms to severe life-threatening attacks.

---

## When to See a Doctor
- frequent breathing difficulty  
- symptoms interfering with daily life  
- worsening wheezing  
- poor response to inhalers  

---

## Diagnosis
Confirmed using lung function tests such as:

- spirometry  
- airway responsiveness testing  

---

## Treatment Overview
Asthma is managed with:

- long-term control medications  
- quick-relief inhalers  
- trigger avoidance  

Early and consistent management prevents severe attacks.

---

## Prevention Strategy
- avoid known triggers  
- follow prescribed medication plans  
- monitor breathing patterns  
- maintain a personalized asthma action plan  

---

## Trigger Pattern
Symptoms commonly appear after exposure to allergens, exercise, cold air, or irritants.

---

## Quick Differentiation

- **Asthma:** Wheezing with episodic breathlessness, usually without fever  
- **COPD:** Persistent breathing difficulty that progressively worsens  
- **Pneumonia:** Fever + cough + infection signs  
- **Allergic Reaction:** Sudden breathing issue with swelling or rash  

---

## Dominant Symptom Cluster
**Wheezing + episodic shortness of breath + trigger exposure**
