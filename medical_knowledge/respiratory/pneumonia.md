# Pneumonia

## Category
Acute Lung Infection

---

## Description
Pneumonia is a lung infection that causes inflammation and fluid buildup in the air sacs (**alveoli**), making breathing difficult. It may be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi and can range from mild to life-threatening.

---

## Diagnostic Hint
Suspect pneumonia when **fever and cough** occur together with:

- mucus production  
- chest pain  
- shortness of breath  
- rapid breathing  

---

## Core Symptom Pattern
**Acute infectious breathing illness with fever and productive cough.**

---

## Common Symptoms
- high fever  
- cough producing yellow, green, or bloody mucus  
- shortness of breath  
- chest pain (especially during breathing or coughing)  
- fatigue  
- chills or sweating  
- rapid breathing  
- loss of appetite  

---

## Key Differentiating Symptoms
These strongly indicate pneumonia:

- productive cough with colored mucus  
- chest pain linked to breathing  
- persistent high fever  
- rapid breathing  
- confusion (especially in older adults)  

---

## Rare Symptoms
- bluish lips or nails (low oxygen)  
- vomiting  
- abdominal pain  
- altered mental state  

---

##  Emergency Signs
Seek immediate medical care if:

- severe breathing difficulty develops  
- lips or nails turn blue  
- confusion occurs  
- fever exceeds **102°F (38.8°C)**  
- signs of sepsis appear  
- the patient cannot stay awake  

---

## Cause
Pneumonia occurs when infectious organisms inflame the lungs.

---

## Common Pathogens
- **Streptococcus pneumoniae** (most common bacterial cause)  
- influenza virus  
- COVID-19 virus  
- respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)  
- *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*  

---

## Transmission Mode
Often spreads through **respiratory droplets** from coughing or sneezing, depending on the pathogen.

---

## Incubation Pattern
Varies by organism but typically develops within a few days after a respiratory infection.

---

## Disease Pattern
Acute infection that typically worsens without treatment.

---

## Symptom Onset
Usually sudden.

---

## Progression Speed
Rapid — often within days.

---

## Fever Presence
Common and often high.

(This is a MAJOR separator from asthma and COPD.)

---

## Infection Location
Primarily affects the **lung alveoli**.

---

## Risk Factors
- age above 65 or below 2  
- smoking  
- weakened immune system  
- chronic lung or heart disease  
- recent respiratory infection  
- hospitalization  

---

## Commonly Confused With
- asthma  
- bronchitis  
- COVID-19  
- influenza  
- tuberculosis  

---

## Severity Level
Ranges from mild illness to life-threatening infection, especially in older adults or immunocompromised individuals.

---

## When to See a Doctor
- persistent high fever  
- worsening cough with mucus  
- chest pain  
- breathing difficulty  
- symptoms not improving  

---

## Diagnosis
Typically confirmed using:

- chest X-ray  
- blood tests  
- sputum analysis  

---

## Treatment Overview
Treatment depends on the cause and may include:

- antibiotics  
- antivirals  
- antifungals  
- oxygen therapy  
- supportive care  

Early treatment greatly improves outcomes.

---

## Prevention
- vaccination (pneumococcal, influenza, COVID-19)  
- proper hand hygiene  
- avoid smoking  
- maintain strong immunity  

---

## Quick Differentiation

- **Pneumonia:** Fever + productive cough + infection  
- **Asthma:** Wheezing with episodic breathlessness (usually no fever)  
- **COPD:** Progressive breathing difficulty with chronic cough  
- **Bronchitis:** Persistent cough without severe lung infection  

---

## Dominant Symptom Cluster
**High fever + productive cough + breathing difficulty**
