# Tuberculosis (TB)

## Category
Chronic Bacterial Infection (Airborne)

---

## Description
Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious bacterial infection caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. It primarily affects the lungs but can spread to other organs such as the spine, brain, or kidneys if untreated.

---

## Diagnostic Hint
Suspect tuberculosis when a **persistent cough lasting more than two weeks** occurs together with:

- unexplained weight loss  
- night sweats  
- fever  
- fatigue  

---

## Core Symptom Pattern
**Slow, progressive respiratory illness with systemic symptoms.**

---

## Common Symptoms
- persistent cough (longer than 2–3 weeks)  
- coughing up blood or mucus  
- chest pain  
- fatigue or weakness  
- unexplained weight loss  
- fever  
- night sweats  
- chills  
- loss of appetite  

---

## Key Differentiating Symptoms
These strongly suggest tuberculosis:

- chronic cough lasting weeks  
- night sweats  
- unexplained weight loss  
- blood in sputum  
- gradual symptom progression  

---

## Rare Symptoms
- spinal pain (spinal TB)  
- neurological symptoms (TB meningitis)  
- swollen lymph nodes  
- infection in organs outside the lungs  

---

##  Emergency Signs
Seek immediate medical care if:

- severe breathing difficulty occurs  
- significant coughing of blood develops  
- extreme weakness appears  
- altered mental status is observed  

---

## Cause
TB is caused by the bacterium *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.

---

## Transmission Mode
Spreads through **airborne droplets** when an infected person:

- coughs  
- sneezes  
- talks  
- laughs  

---

## Incubation Pattern
The bacteria can remain dormant in the body for years before becoming active.

---

## Latent vs Active TB

### Latent TB
- Infection present  
- No symptoms  
- Not contagious  

### Active TB
- Symptomatic  
- Contagious  
- Requires immediate treatment  

(This distinction is VERY important for diagnostic reasoning.)

---

## Disease Pattern
Chronic illness that gradually worsens without treatment.

---

## Symptom Onset
Gradual but infectious.

---

## Progression Speed
Slow — typically weeks to months.

---

## Symptom Duration
Long-lasting and persistent.

---

## Risk Factors
- weakened immune system  
- diabetes or kidney disease  
- HIV infection  
- organ transplant  
- chemotherapy  
- close contact with infected individuals  
- living in high-prevalence regions  
- crowded living conditions  

---

## Commonly Confused With
- pneumonia  
- chronic bronchitis  
- lung cancer  
- COPD  

---

## Severity Level
Potentially fatal if untreated — but **curable with long-term antibiotics**.

---

## When to See a Doctor
- cough lasting more than two weeks  
- coughing blood  
- persistent fever  
- unexplained weight loss  
- prolonged fatigue  

---

## Diagnosis
Typically confirmed using:

- TB skin or blood tests  
- chest imaging  
- sputum analysis  

---

## Treatment Overview
Requires **long-term combination antibiotics** for several months to fully eliminate the bacteria.

Stopping treatment early can cause drug resistance.

---

## Prevention
- early testing after exposure  
- proper ventilation  
- respiratory hygiene  
- completing prescribed treatment  

---

## Quick Differentiation

- **Tuberculosis:** Chronic cough + weight loss + night sweats  
- **Pneumonia:** Acute fever with productive cough  
- **COPD:** Progressive breathlessness with smoking history  
- **Asthma:** Episodic wheezing without infection

## Dominant Symptom Cluster
**Chronic cough + weight loss + night sweats**
