# Bronchitis

## Category
Airway Inflammation (Usually Viral)

---

## Description
Bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchial tubes — the airways that carry air to the lungs. The condition causes mucus buildup and a persistent cough. Most cases are acute and follow a viral respiratory infection.

---

## Diagnostic Hint
Suspect bronchitis when a **mucus-producing cough lasts 1–3 weeks**, especially after a recent cold or flu.

---

## Core Symptom Pattern
Subacute cough with mucus caused by airway inflammation.

---

## Common Symptoms
- persistent cough (lasting 1–3 weeks)  
- cough producing mucus  
- wheezing  
- mild shortness of breath  
- fatigue  
- chest discomfort  
- low-grade fever  
- runny nose  

---

## Key Differentiating Symptoms
Signs strongly suggesting bronchitis:

- nagging cough that lingers after a viral illness  
- mucus production without severe breathing distress  
- symptoms improve gradually  
- typically viral rather than bacterial  

---

## Rare Symptoms
- high fever  
- coughing up blood  
- prolonged breathing difficulty  

These may indicate a more serious condition.

---

##  Emergency Signs
Seek urgent care if:

- severe shortness of breath develops  
- high persistent fever occurs  
- chest pain is present  
- confusion appears  
- symptoms suggest pneumonia  

---

## Cause
Most commonly caused by respiratory viruses such as:

- influenza  
- respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)  
- coronavirus  
- rhinovirus  

It can also result from airway irritation due to smoke, pollution, or chemical exposure.

---

## Disease Pattern
Usually **acute and self-limiting**.

Chronic bronchitis may indicate **COPD** and requires medical evaluation.

---

## Progression Speed
Develops over several days and improves gradually.

---

## Symptom Duration
Typically **1–3 weeks**, though cough may persist slightly longer during recovery.

---

## Transmission Mode
Varies by cause. Viral bronchitis spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing.

---

## Risk Factors
- smoking  
- exposure to air pollution  
- asthma or COPD  
- weakened immune system  
- frequent respiratory infections  

---

## Commonly Confused With
- pneumonia  
- asthma  
- COPD  
- influenza  
- COVID-19  

---

## Severity Level
Generally mild — but can worsen in older adults or those with underlying lung disease.

---

## When to See a Doctor
- cough lasting more than 3 weeks  
- coughing blood  
- high fever  
- worsening breathing difficulty  

---

## Diagnosis
Primarily clinical. Chest imaging may be used to rule out pneumonia.

---

## Treatment Overview
Treatment focuses on symptom relief.

Antibiotics are **rarely needed** unless bacterial infection is suspected.

---

## Prevention
- avoid smoking and lung irritants  
- practice good hand hygiene  
- stay updated on respiratory vaccines  

---

## Infection Location
Bronchial tubes (airways)

---

## Dominant Symptom
Persistent mucus-producing cough.

---

## Quick Differentiation

**Bronchitis:** mucus cough without severe breathing distress  
**Pneumonia:** high fever + chest pain + breathing difficulty  
**Asthma:** wheezing with episodic attacks  
**COPD:** progressive breathlessness with smoking history  

---

## Clinical Insight
Bronchitis often acts as a transitional illness between a mild upper respiratory infection and pneumonia. Careful monitoring prevents missed complications.
