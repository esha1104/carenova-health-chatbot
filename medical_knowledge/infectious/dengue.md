# Dengue Fever

## Category
Viral Infection (Mosquito-borne)

---

## Description
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by the dengue virus and transmitted primarily by *Aedes* mosquitoes. It is common in tropical and subtropical regions and can range from a mild flu-like illness to severe, life-threatening disease.

---

## Diagnostic Hint
Suspect dengue when a **sudden high fever** occurs together with:

- severe headache  
- pain behind the eyes  
- intense muscle and joint pain  
- skin rash  

---

## Common Symptoms
- Sudden high fever (up to 104°F / 40°C)  
- Severe headache  
- Pain behind the eyes  
- Muscle pain  
- Joint pain  
- Nausea  
- Vomiting  
- Skin rash  
- Fatigue  
- Swollen glands  

---

## Key Differentiating Symptoms
These help distinguish dengue from other febrile illnesses:

- Intense pain behind the eyes  
- Rash appearing after the fever  
- Severe muscle and joint pain (“breakbone fever”)  

---

## Rare Symptoms
- Mild bleeding from gums  
- Nosebleeds  
- Easy bruising  

---

## Emergency Signs 
Seek **immediate medical care** if any of the following occur:

- Severe abdominal pain  
- Persistent vomiting  
- Blood in vomit, urine, or stool  
- Difficulty breathing  
- Extreme fatigue  
- Irritability or restlessness  

---

## Cause
Infection with one of four dengue virus strains transmitted through infected mosquito bites.

---

## Incubation Period
Typically **4–10 days** after being bitten by an infected mosquito.

---

## Risk Factors
- Living in tropical or subtropical regions  
- Recent travel to endemic areas  
- Previous dengue infection (increases risk of severe dengue)  

---

## Commonly Confused With
- Malaria  
- Chikungunya  
- Typhoid  
- Influenza  

---

## Severity Level
Dengue can progress to **severe dengue (dengue hemorrhagic fever)** which may cause:

- internal bleeding  
- shock  
- organ failure  

Early medical attention greatly reduces risk.

---

## When to See a Doctor
- Fever lasting more than **2 days**  
- Symptoms worsen after initial improvement  
- Any signs of bleeding  

---

## Prevention
- Avoid mosquito bites  
- Use insect repellents containing DEET  
- Wear long-sleeved clothing  
- Remove standing water near living areas  

---

## Disease Progression Pattern
1. Sudden onset  
2. High fever phase  
3. Critical phase (risk of bleeding)  
4. Recovery phase  

---

## Fever Pattern
**Sudden onset high fever**

**Comparison:**  
- Dengue → sudden fever  
- Typhoid → gradual stepwise fever  

---

## Joint Involvement
Mild to moderate joint pain.

---

## Primary Risk
Bleeding and circulatory shock.

---

## Dominant Symptom Cluster
**High fever + severe body pain + eye pain**
