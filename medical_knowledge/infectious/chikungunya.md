# Chikungunya

## Category
Viral Infection (Mosquito-borne)

---

## Description
Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted through infected **Aedes mosquitoes**. It is characterized by sudden fever and **severe, often disabling joint pain** that may persist for weeks or even months after the initial infection.

---

## Diagnostic Hint
Suspect chikungunya when **sudden fever** occurs together with:

- intense joint pain  
- joint swelling  
- rash  
- recent mosquito exposure  

---

## Common Symptoms
- sudden high fever  
- severe joint pain  
- joint swelling  
- headache  
- muscle pain  
- rash  
- fatigue  
- nausea  

---

## Key Differentiating Symptoms
These features strongly distinguish chikungunya from other mosquito-borne illnesses:

- crippling joint pain (often worse than the fever)  
- noticeable joint swelling  
- bent or stooped posture due to pain  
- joint pain that may persist for weeks or months  

---

## Rare Symptoms
- neurological complications  
- heart inflammation  
- eye problems  

---

##  Emergency Signs
Seek immediate medical care if:

- confusion develops  
- difficulty breathing occurs  
- chest pain appears  
- seizures happen  
- the patient cannot stay awake  

---

## Cause
Chikungunya is caused by the **chikungunya virus**, transmitted through the bite of infected **Aedes aegypti** or **Aedes albopictus** mosquitoes.

---

## Incubation Period
Typically **3–7 days** after a mosquito bite  
(range: **2–12 days**).

---

## Fever Pattern
Sudden onset fever similar to dengue — but **joint involvement is significantly more severe**.

---

## Joint Involvement
One of the strongest diagnostic indicators:

**Severe joint pain with swelling that can become disabling**

---

## Transmission Mode
Primarily spread through mosquito bites.

Rarely, transmission may occur via infected blood.

---

## Risk Factors
- travel to outbreak regions  
- living in tropical climates  
- older adults (65+)  
- newborns  
- individuals with chronic medical conditions  

---

## Commonly Confused With
- dengue  
- malaria  
- zika virus  
- viral fever  

---

## Severity Level
Usually not fatal, but may cause **chronic joint pain** that impacts mobility and quality of life.

---

## Primary Risk
Long-term or chronic joint pain.

---

## When to See a Doctor
- sudden fever after travel  
- severe joint pain  
- symptoms not improving  
- suspected mosquito exposure  

---

## Diagnosis
Confirmed through **blood tests** detecting chikungunya antibodies or viral genetic material.

---

## Treatment Overview
There is **no specific antiviral cure**.

Treatment focuses on:

- pain relief  
- fever control  
- hydration  
- rest  

---

## Prevention
- use mosquito repellents  
- wear protective clothing  
- eliminate standing water  
- sleep under mosquito nets  
- consider vaccination where available  

---

## Progression Pattern
Typical course of illness:

1. Sudden fever phase  
2. Severe joint pain phase  
3. Recovery within about one week (most cases)  
4. Possible chronic joint pain lasting months or years  

---

## Quick Differentiation

- **Dengue:** Severe muscle/body pain with bleeding risk  
- **Chikungunya:** Severe joint pain with swelling  
- **Malaria:** Cyclical fever with chills and sweating  
- **Typhoid:** Gradual persistent fever with abdominal pain

## Dominant Symptom Cluster
**Sudden fever + severe joint pain + joint swelling**
