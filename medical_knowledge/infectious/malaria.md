## Category
Parasitic Infection (Mosquito-borne)

## Description
Malaria is a potentially life-threatening infectious disease caused by *Plasmodium* parasites and transmitted through the bite of infected **Anopheles mosquitoes**. After entering the body, the parasites first infect the liver and then spread to red blood cells, leading to recurring fever episodes and systemic illness.

Suspect malaria when **cyclical fever** occurs together with:

- shaking chills  
- heavy sweating after fever  
- fatigue  
- headache  
- recent travel to a tropical or endemic region
