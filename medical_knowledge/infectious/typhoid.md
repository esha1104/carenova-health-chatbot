# Typhoid Fever

## Category
Bacterial Infection (Systemic / Enteric)

---

## Description
Typhoid fever is a serious bacterial infection caused by *Salmonella Typhi*. It primarily affects the digestive system but can spread into the bloodstream, leading to severe complications if left untreated.

---

## Diagnostic Hint
Suspect typhoid when a **gradually rising persistent fever** occurs together with:

- abdominal pain  
- weakness and fatigue  
- headache  
- gastrointestinal symptoms  
- loss of appetite  

---

## Common Symptoms
- prolonged high fever (often rising stepwise up to 104°F / 40°C)  
- severe abdominal pain  
- loss of appetite  
- fatigue and weakness  
- headache  
- muscle aches  
- sweating  
- constipation or diarrhea  

---

## Key Differentiating Symptoms
These features help distinguish typhoid from other fever illnesses:

- **stepwise rising fever** (not sudden like dengue)  
- abdominal pain more prominent than body pain  
- rose spots (faint pink rash on chest or abdomen)  
- persistent fever lasting several days  

---

## Rare Symptoms
- delirium ("typhoid state")  
- extreme exhaustion  
- confusion  

---

##  Emergency Signs
Seek immediate medical care if any of the following occur:

- sudden severe abdominal pain (possible intestinal perforation)  
- bloody stools  
- vomiting blood  
- severe confusion  
- inability to stay awake  

---

## Cause
Typhoid fever is caused by the bacterium *Salmonella Typhi*.

---

## Transmission Mode
Typhoid spreads through the **fecal-oral route**, commonly via:

- contaminated drinking water  
- improperly handled food  
- raw produce washed with contaminated water  

---

## Incubation Period
Typically **1–2 weeks** after exposure.

---

## Fever Pattern
Typhoid is strongly associated with a **gradually rising, stepwise fever** that becomes persistent over time.

---

## Risk Factors
- living in areas with poor sanitation  
- unsafe drinking water  
- travel to endemic regions  
- close contact with infected individuals  

---

## Commonly Confused With
- dengue  
- malaria  
- viral fever  
- gastroenteritis  

---

## Severity Level
Typhoid can become life-threatening without antibiotic treatment due to risks such as intestinal bleeding, perforation, or systemic infection.

---

## When to See a Doctor
- persistent fever lasting more than 3 days  
- recent travel to high-risk regions  
- worsening abdominal pain  
- extreme fatigue  

---

## Diagnosis
Confirmed through laboratory testing such as blood culture or stool tests to detect *Salmonella Typhi*.

---

## Treatment Overview
Typhoid is treated with **targeted antibiotics**. Early treatment significantly reduces the risk of complications.

---

## Prevention
- drink boiled or bottled water  
- practice proper hand hygiene  
- avoid raw or street food in high-risk areas  
- consider vaccination before traveling to endemic regions  

---

## Progression Pattern
Typical disease progression:

1. Gradual fever onset  
2. Increasing abdominal symptoms  
3. Persistent high fever  
4. Potential intestinal complications  

---

## Quick Differentiation

- **Dengue:** Sudden high fever with severe body pain  
- **Malaria:** Cyclical fever with chills and sweating  
- **Typhoid:** Gradually rising persistent fever with abdominal pain  

---

## Dominant Symptom Cluster
**Persistent stepwise fever + abdominal pain + fatigue**
