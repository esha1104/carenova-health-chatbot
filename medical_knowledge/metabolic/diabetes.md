# Diabetes Mellitus

## Category
Chronic Metabolic Disorder

---

## Description
Diabetes mellitus is a long-term metabolic condition in which the body cannot properly regulate blood glucose (sugar) levels due to insufficient insulin production or ineffective insulin use.

Persistently elevated blood sugar can damage the heart, kidneys, nerves, eyes, and blood vessels over time.

---

## Diagnostic Hint
Suspect diabetes when **excessive thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, and persistent fatigue** occur together — especially if symptoms develop gradually.

---

## Core Symptom Pattern
Chronic metabolic symptoms caused by elevated blood glucose.

---

## Dominant Symptoms
- excessive thirst (polydipsia)  
- frequent urination (polyuria)  
- persistent fatigue  

---

## Common Symptoms
- increased hunger (polyphagia)  
- unexplained weight loss  
- blurred vision  
- slow-healing wounds  
- recurrent skin or urinary infections  
- numbness or tingling in hands and feet  
- dry mouth  
- itchy skin  

---

## Key Differentiating Features
Strong indicators of diabetes:

- symptoms persist for weeks or months  
- no clear infection trigger  
- excessive urination even without high fluid intake  
- recurrent infections  
- slow wound healing  

Many people — especially with Type 2 diabetes — may have **no symptoms for years.**

## Major Types

### Type 1 Diabetes
- Autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells  
- Often begins in childhood or adolescence  
- Rapid symptom onset  
- Requires lifelong insulin  

### Type 2 Diabetes
- Caused by insulin resistance  
- Develops gradually  
- Strongly linked to lifestyle factors  
- Most common form  

### Prediabetes
Blood sugar is higher than normal but not yet diabetic.

Highly reversible with lifestyle changes.

---

## Rare Symptoms
- ketones in urine  
- severe dehydration  
- mood changes  
- confusion  
- persistent nausea  

Often signal dangerously high blood sugar.

---

##  Emergency Signs (Possible Diabetic Ketoacidosis)

Seek immediate medical care if ANY occur:

- fruity-smelling breath  
- rapid or deep breathing  
- severe dehydration  
- persistent vomiting  
- abdominal pain  
- confusion  
- extreme drowsiness  
- loss of consciousness  

This is a medical emergency.

---

## Cause
Occurs when:

- the pancreas produces little or no insulin, OR  
- the body becomes resistant to insulin  

Both lead to excess glucose in the bloodstream.

---

## Disease Pattern
Chronic and progressive.

Requires lifelong monitoring.

---

## Progression Speed
Usually slow — but Type 1 diabetes can develop rapidly.

---

## Risk Factors
- overweight or obesity  
- sedentary lifestyle  
- family history  
- high blood pressure  
- unhealthy diet  
- age over 40  
- history of gestational diabetes  

---

## Commonly Confused With
- thyroid disorders  
- chronic fatigue syndrome  
- anemia  
- depression  
- dehydration  

---

## Severity Level
Serious but manageable.

Untreated diabetes can lead to:

- heart disease  
- kidney failure  
- nerve damage  
- vision loss  
- stroke  

---

## When to See a Doctor
- persistent thirst  
- frequent urination  
- unexplained weight loss  
- ongoing fatigue  
- recurrent infections  

Early diagnosis greatly reduces complications.

---

## Diagnosis
Confirmed through blood glucose testing such as:

- fasting blood sugar  
- HbA1c  
- oral glucose tolerance test  

---

## Treatment Overview
Management focuses on controlling blood sugar through:

- lifestyle modifications  
- regular glucose monitoring  
- medications or insulin therapy  

---

## Prevention (Mainly Type 2)
- maintain healthy weight  
- exercise regularly  
- eat a balanced, high-fiber diet  
- reduce processed sugar intake  

Even modest weight loss significantly lowers risk.

---

## Fever Pattern
Typically absent unless infection is present.

---

## Onset Pattern
Slow and silent rather than sudden.

Many people remain undiagnosed for years.

---

## Clinical Insight

### Diabetes vs Infection Fatigue

**Diabetes:** chronic fatigue + thirst + urination  
**Infection:** fever + acute onset  

Always evaluate persistent metabolic symptoms.
