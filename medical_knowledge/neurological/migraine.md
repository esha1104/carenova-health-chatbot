# Migraine

## Category
Neurological Disorder

---

## Description
Migraine is a recurrent neurological condition that causes moderate to severe throbbing headaches, often affecting one side of the head and commonly accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light and sound.

---

## Diagnostic Hint
Suspect migraine when a **gradually worsening pulsating headache** is triggered by sensory stimuli (light, sound, smell) and improves with rest in a dark, quiet environment.

---

## Core Symptom Pattern
Recurrent throbbing headache with sensory hypersensitivity.

---

## Dominant Symptom
Severe pulsating headache.

---

## Common Symptoms
- throbbing or pulsating head pain  
- one-sided headache  
- nausea  
- vomiting  
- sensitivity to light (photophobia)  
- sensitivity to sound (phonophobia)  
- sensitivity to smells  
- fatigue  
- dizziness  
- difficulty concentrating  

---

## Key Differentiating Features
Strong indicators of migraine:

- recurring headache episodes  
- pain worsens with movement or activity  
- relief with rest in a dark room  
- nausea accompanying headache  
- sensory sensitivity  
- typically **no fever**  

---

## Aura Symptoms (Occurs in Some Patients)
Neurological warning signs appearing before the headache:

- flashing lights  
- blind spots  
- zigzag vision  
- numbness or tingling  
- difficulty speaking  

Aura usually lasts **5–60 minutes**.

---

## Rare Symptoms
- temporary vision loss  
- muscle weakness  
- confusion  
- vertigo  

These require medical evaluation.

---

##  Emergency Signs (DO NOT IGNORE)

Seek immediate care if ANY occur:

- sudden **“worst headache of life”**  
- headache after a head injury  
- seizures  
- persistent confusion  
- vision loss  
- trouble speaking  
- facial drooping  
- weakness on one side of the body  

These may indicate **stroke, brain bleed, or meningitis — NOT migraine.**

---

## Cause
Exact cause is unknown but linked to abnormal brain signaling, nerve activation, and genetic susceptibility.

---

## Disease Pattern
Recurrent neurological episodes.

---

## Onset Pattern
Gradual buildup — not explosive.

(Sudden onset suggests a dangerous alternative diagnosis.)

---

## Fever Pattern
Absent.

Fever + headache should trigger evaluation for infection.

---

## Progression Speed
Pain increases over 30–120 minutes.

---

## Episode Duration
Typically **4–72 hours**.

---

## Common Triggers
- stress  
- sleep disruption  
- hormonal changes  
- bright lights  
- loud noises  
- strong odors  
- missed meals  
- dehydration  
- weather changes  
- excessive caffeine  

---

## Risk Factors
- family history  
- female gender  
- anxiety or depression  
- sleep disorders  
- epilepsy  

---

## Commonly Confused With

### Tension Headache
- band-like pressure  
- milder intensity  
- no nausea  

### Sinus Headache
- facial pressure  
- nasal congestion  

### Meningitis
- fever  
- stiff neck  
- confusion  

### Brain Hemorrhage
- instant severe headache  

### Cluster Headache
- severe pain around one eye  
- tearing  
- nasal congestion  

---

## Severity Level
Not usually life-threatening but can be severely disabling.

---

## When to See a Doctor
- migraines becoming frequent  
- worsening intensity  
- new neurological symptoms  
- headaches interfering with daily life  
- first severe headache after age 50  

---

## Diagnosis
Primarily clinical.

Imaging may be used to rule out dangerous causes.

---

## Treatment Overview
Managed with:

- acute pain medications  
- preventive medications  
- trigger avoidance  
- lifestyle regulation  

---

## Prevention
- maintain regular sleep schedule  
- manage stress  
- stay hydrated  
- eat meals on time  
- avoid known triggers  

---

## Clinical Insight

### Migraine vs Dangerous Headache

**Migraine:** gradual, throbbing, recurrent  
**Brain bleed:** sudden explosive pain  
**Meningitis:** fever + stiff neck  
**Stroke:** neurological deficits  

Sudden onset headaches are NEVER assumed to be migraine.
